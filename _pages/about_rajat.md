I am a Civil-Structural Engineer and Chartered Engineer (India), with deep expertise in the analysis, design, and cost estimation of:

- Steel structures
- Pre-engineered buildings (PEB)
- Cold-formed steel structures
- Reinforced concrete buildings

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in the Department of Civil Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee (IIT Roorkee), where my research centers on the computational modelling of train–track–bridge interaction. My work integrates vehicle dynamics, wheel–rail contact mechanics, and bridge engineering — with the goal of developing safer, more resilient, and efficient railway infrastructure systems.

Beyond research, I am deeply committed to mentoring and training the next generation of structural engineers. Through teaching, academic supervision, industry consulting, and delivering practical design solutions, I strive to bridge the gap between theory and real-world application.

My mission is to contribute meaningfully to resilient infrastructure by combining rigorous research, innovative thinking, and optimized, constructible engineering solutions that serve both present needs and future demands.

I welcome opportunities to collaborate on challenging structural projects, research, or knowledge-sharing initiatives in civil and structural engineering.
