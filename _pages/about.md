I am Rajat Abhay Sirsikar, a Civil Structural Engineer and Chartered Engineer (India). My expertise lies in the analysis, design, and estimation of steel structures, pre-engineered buildings, cold-formed structures, and reinforced concrete buildings. I possess in-depth knowledge of various Indian, European, and American structural codes.

Currently pursuing my Ph.D. at Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, my research focuses on computational modelling of train-track-bridge interaction which lies at the intersection of vehicle dynamics, contact mechanics, and bridge engineering; aiming to contribute to safer and more resilient railway infrastructure.

I am passionate about advancing sustainable and resilient infrastructure through research, consulting, and practical engineering solutions.
