abstract="The rapid developments in the field of machine learning (ML) have introduced new possibilities for addressing the complex dynamics involved in train--track--bridge (TTB) interactions. Traditional approaches in dynamic analysis of railway bridges are computationally intensive and require significant expertise. This study investigates the application of ML algorithms to predict the dynamic acceleration response of railway bridges under high-speed train loads. A comprehensive dataset of 800,000 randomly generated bridge configurations was utilized to train and validate the models. The regression analysis performed with moderate accuracy and was unable to fully capture the nonlinear interactions among variables. To address this limitation, a Random Forest model was implemented, significantly enhancing prediction accuracy. The model's performance indicates its high reliability and suitability for practical applications in structural engineering, particularly in the preliminary assessment of railway bridges. This research contributes to the application of predictive modeling in railway bridge engineering, laying the foundation work for studying the complex dynamics involved in TTB modeling.",

abstract="Existing building codes do not specify the performance criteria of individual structural members under various levels of shaking during earthquake or ground motions. Thus, several developing and developed countries all across the world have incorporated changes in their seismic codes for practical applications. In India, there is no proper description of the `Earthquake-Resistant' building. Buildings should be clearly categorised and designed according to performance objectives. Strict guidelines must be laid down that all buildings should be designated, designed and offered as `Earthquake-Resistant-Collapse Prevention/Life Safety/Immediate Occupancy'. It is interesting to know that India is the only seismic-prone country in the world that has neither its own performance-based seismic design (PSBD) code nor a dedicated hospital design code. Moreover, in the current Indian seismic code, displacements and forces are within the elastic limit, i.e., the assumed behaviour is linear. However, the structural response to the major earthquake is not elastic. The formation of plastic hinges exceeding collapse prevention state occurs in most structural members. Retrofitting had also proved to be uneconomical for the buildings to perform better under severe earthquakes. This paper presents a comparative PBSD analysis of G{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}4 regular and all five types of plan irregular RC frames using response spectrum and time history methods in Zone IV and Zone V as per IS 1893:2016. The primary objective of the study is to verify the essential dimensions of primary structural members in the lifeline structures condition of collapse prevention and life safety. The time-history data for Bhuj earthquake was used for this analysis. The pushover analysis is then carried out to study the inelastic behaviour of the structure. The research is very useful for practising structural engineers to determine the minimum dimensions of slabs, beams and columns in different configurations of normal and plan irregular frames to be carried out in the state of life safety and collapse prevention.",
