abstract="The rapid developments in the field of machine learning (ML) have introduced new possibilities for addressing the complex dynamics involved in train--track--bridge (TTB) interactions. Traditional approaches in dynamic analysis of railway bridges are computationally intensive and require significant expertise. This study investigates the application of ML algorithms to predict the dynamic acceleration response of railway bridges under high-speed train loads. A comprehensive dataset of 800,000 randomly generated bridge configurations was utilized to train and validate the models. The regression analysis performed with moderate accuracy and was unable to fully capture the nonlinear interactions among variables. To address this limitation, a Random Forest model was implemented, significantly enhancing prediction accuracy. The model's performance indicates its high reliability and suitability for practical applications in structural engineering, particularly in the preliminary assessment of railway bridges. This research contributes to the application of predictive modeling in railway bridge engineering, laying the foundation work for studying the complex dynamics involved in TTB modeling.",

abstract="Existing building codes do not specify the performance criteria of individual structural members under various levels of shaking during earthquake or ground motions. Thus, several developing and developed countries all across the world have incorporated changes in their seismic codes for practical applications. In India, there is no proper description of the `Earthquake-Resistant' building. Buildings should be clearly categorised and designed according to performance objectives. Strict guidelines must be laid down that all buildings should be designated, designed and offered as `Earthquake-Resistant-Collapse Prevention/Life Safety/Immediate Occupancy'. It is interesting to know that India is the only seismic-prone country in the world that has neither its own performance-based seismic design (PSBD) code nor a dedicated hospital design code. Moreover, in the current Indian seismic code, displacements and forces are within the elastic limit, i.e., the assumed behaviour is linear. However, the structural response to the major earthquake is not elastic. The formation of plastic hinges exceeding collapse prevention state occurs in most structural members. Retrofitting had also proved to be uneconomical for the buildings to perform better under severe earthquakes. This paper presents a comparative PBSD analysis of G{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}4 regular and all five types of plan irregular RC frames using response spectrum and time history methods in Zone IV and Zone V as per IS 1893:2016. The primary objective of the study is to verify the essential dimensions of primary structural members in the lifeline structures condition of collapse prevention and life safety. The time-history data for Bhuj earthquake was used for this analysis. The pushover analysis is then carried out to study the inelastic behaviour of the structure. The research is very useful for practising structural engineers to determine the minimum dimensions of slabs, beams and columns in different configurations of normal and plan irregular frames to be carried out in the state of life safety and collapse prevention.",

abstract="Currently, structural engineers design structures as fixed bases, ignoring soil-structure interaction (SSI). Due to difficulties in the modelling of soil and the absence of procedure to incorporate effects of SSI in seismic design codes. Various researchers have shown the importance of considering SSI during earthquakes. This paper highlights the interaction effects of SSI, its seismic response, the general procedure for engineers to incorporate the impact of SSI. Various methods to solve SSI problems and their provisions are mentioned in different International Seismic Codes reviewed. However, there is an urgent need to incorporate detailed guidelines considering SSI effects in the Indian Seismic code. Thus, Indian engineers should reach for international Codes or other available literature to solve their SSI assignments.",

DOI={10.28991/CEJ-2022-08-02-09}, 
abstract="Due to the high cost and less availability of land, the buildings are constructed adjacent to each other with a significantly smaller separation gap. Whenever seismic forces act on adjacent structures, they collide and cause significant structural and architectural damage. Soil-Structure Interaction (SSI) effects cause more complications in the adjacent structures. This paper assesses the gap distance between RC bare frame adjacent structures of varying heights in medium and soft soil with and without SSI to avoid the pounding effect of an earthquake. The main objectives are to find the separation distance between adjacent buildings by the provisions of FEMA 356, IS 1893 (Part 1):2002, IS 1893 (Part 1):2016 and EN 1998-1:2004. The separation gap between different codes was then compared to determine the minimum separation required to prevent pounding between the structures. The maximum lateral displacement on the roof and the time period of the adjacent buildings are compared with and without SSI. There is a significant increase in lateral displacement, separation distance, and time period considering SSI. It is found that the Indian code overestimates the separation distance. Thus, this study guides structural engineers to maintain a minimum separation distance between buildings erected on medium and soft soils in high seismic zones of India.",

title="Pro-Ecological Utilization of Crushed Concrete as an Aggregate to Improve the Compressive Strength with Steel Fibers and Styrene-Butadiene Rubber Latex",
abstract="Demolition of old structures and pro-ecological utilisation of such demolished concrete waste materials must be considered an important ecological issue that helps conserve non-renewable natural resources. Crushed concrete in the form of recycled coarse aggregate (RCA), steel fibres (SF) of 30 kg/m3–50 kg/m3 and Styrene-Butadiene Rubber (SBR) latex of 5%, 10%, and 15% by cement weight attempted to strengthen the strength in compression of Polymer Modified Steel Fiber Reinforced Crushed Concrete (PMSFRCC). Ninety-nine cubes each of M20, M25, M30, and M40 grade were cast separately to assess the strength in compression of Natural Aggregate Concrete (NAC), Crushed Concrete (CC), and PMSFRCC. According to the experimental results, PMSFRCC with SF 30 kg/m3 and SBR Latex 5% by weight of cement improves compressive strength by 8.92% \& 6.22% in mix-1, 7.63% \& 5.45% in mix-2, 4.27% \& 7.87% in mix-3, and 9.87% \& 7.46% in mix-4 when compared to NAC at 28 and 90 days.It reflects significant improvement and validation of utilisation of CC as a potential source of an aggregate to improve compressive strength for the desired purpose.",
